        No one has ever emailed me asking about my hardware or software like they might do with 
        <a href="https://wesbos.com/uses">someone more well-known</a>. 
        Regardless, I like discussing tech that can help with productivity and well-being. 
        Here's a loosely-organized (and perpetually incomplete) list of the things I use on a regular basis.

            <li><span class="oblq">Dell Poweredge T110 II</span> - A garage sale pickup a couple years back that replaced my R710 as a slightly more practical spare-bedroom-server-lab machine</li>

            <li>No-Name Laptop Dock - An oddly unmarked USB-C dock to switch monitors and ethernet between laptops. USB accessories are handled through the switch below and then the dock so that switching laptops is a one-plug exercise.</li>

      <p class="foss-note">NOTE: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">Free and Open-Source Software</a> items are <strong>strongly marked üí™</strong></p>
      <ul class="hanging">
        <li><strong>Development Tooling</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a></strong> - Microsoft has won the editor wars, in my opinion; feature rich and extensible.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code</a></strong> - I usually go for simple fonts, but I've come to really appreciate a good set of ligatures. I switched from <a href="https://design.ubuntu.com/font/">Ubuntu Mono</a>.</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/liviuschera/noctis">Noctis</a></strong> - A great theme pack by <a href="https://twitter.com/liviuschera">Liviu Schera</a>; I personally use Minimus (and I hear <a href="https://github.com/draevin">the guy that made that one</a> is pretty cool, too)</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a></strong> - As a lover of FOSS, effective remote work, and tooling that makes easy work of all the things that come along with building software, GitLab is a favorite of mine as a product and a company</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys">PowerToys</a></strong> - The assignable regions for window snapping is a livable replacement for the tiling I've become accustomed on Linux when I'm developing on my Windows machine</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal">Windows Terminal</a></strong> - As a regular WSL user who's used to having tabs, Windows Terminal has been a blessing. I use <a href="https://dahlbyk.github.io/posh-git/">Posh Git</a> with a <a href="https://gist.github.com/draevin/76c081a77b5601b49bb1b8c76f59d23d">lightly customized theme</a> when I'm in PowerShell, as well.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Other Tooling</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a></strong> - Free site hosting? Yes please. Also includes DNS management, easy SSL setup, and more. In fact, this site is hosted there right now!</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh">acme.sh</a></strong> - Easy and effective cert management (and it now integrates with Netlify DNS, among many other providers)</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox VE 6.2</a></strong> - Virtualization platform of choice for all my self-hosting projects</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a></strong> - Natural choice for easy handling of some of my self-hosted apps, whether maintainers provide an image or I craft my own</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible">Ansible</a></strong> - For box setup scripts, managing my internal DNS server/sinkhole, and generally keeping infra config in line with my "Everything As Code" goals</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Personal Management</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> - Notion comes in handy for storing all kinds of info from quick notes and ideas, to spreadsheets and kanban boards. I use the web and Android apps to manage info on personal projects.</li> 
            <li><a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> - Constantly using the Todoist mobile app for my daily checklists. I enjoy the interface and the GTD mindset.</li>
